## PYTHON3

 Its a basic syntax for python string printing.

## WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO ?
 
     Ctrl + Alt + t
     
 Terminal gets opened
 
    gedit <anyname>.py 
    print("HELLO EVERYONE")
    
 Write this on terminal
 
    python3  <your file name>.py
    
 It will print HELLO EVERYONE 
 

ONE THING TO PONDER OVER IS THAT PYTHON PROGRAMS ARE EXECUTED DIRECTLY THEY ARE NOT NEEDED TO BE COMPILED !!
