# PYTHON3
Its a basic syntax for python string printing.

WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO ?
Press Ctrl + Alt + t 
Terminal gets opened
Then write gedit <anyname>.py press enter
The file gets opened
Write print("HELLO EVERYONE")
Execute this code by calling python3  <your file name>.py
It will print HELLO EVERYONE 

ONE THING TO PONDER OVER IS THAT PYTHON PROGRAMS ARE EXECUTED DIRECTLY THEY ARE NOT NEEDED TO BE COMPILED.
